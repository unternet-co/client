    Use one or more tools, then respond to the user based on the tool output.
    This strategy is REQUIRED for file operations - always use this when working with files and directories.
    For file operations, you should:
    1. First list the contents of a directory to see what files are available
    2. Then read or search specific files as needed
    If you already have the required information from a prior tool call DO NOT use this, instead use TEXT (assume all prior information is still up-to-date). If you don't have the required information to use the tool, use TEXT to ask a follow-up question to clarify.
    Here are some tips:
    - You may use as many tools as you wish, it's recommended you err on the side of MORE not less, to retrieve as much relevant information as possible.
    - We also recommend using tool multiple times with different queries to cover more ground.
