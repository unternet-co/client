# Operator

An experimental client for the web from [Unternet](https://unternet.co).

## Setup

- clone the [Web Applets Repo](https://github.com/depatchedmode/web-applets) to the same directory as the Operator Repo. Run `npm build` from the `/sdk` directory so those modules are available.
- Add a `.env` file at `web/.env` and set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>`.
